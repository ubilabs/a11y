# Ubilabs Project Style Guide

## Introduction

This style guide outlines the coding conventions for code developed at Ubilabs.
It covers accessibility practices based on WCAG 2.2 AA standards, as well as general guidelines for writing clean, maintainable, and user-friendly code.

## Key Principles

- **Readability:** Code should be easy to read and understand for all team members.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be easy to update, extend, and debug.
- **Consistency**: Follow project conventions and this style guide.
- **Accessibility**: The resulting application must meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards.
- **Semantics**: Use correct HTML elements and ARIA roles to support assistive technologies.
- **Testing**: Code should include or update relevant unit, integration, or accessibility tests where applicable.

## Comments

- **Write clear and concise comments:** Explain the "why" behind the code, not just the "what".
- **Comment sparingly:** Well-written code should be self-documenting where possible.

## Tooling

- **Code formatter:** [Specify formatter, e.g., Prettier] - Enforces consistent code formatting.
- **Linter:** [Specify linter, e.g., ESLint] â€“ Detects potential issues and enforces style rules.

- Keep review comments short and focused on the key issues.
- Focus on improving the code, not criticizing the developer.
- Offer actionable suggestions, not just point out issues.
- Confirm that code changes do not introduce accessibility barriers.
- Flag any potential violations of WCAG 2.2 AA standards.
